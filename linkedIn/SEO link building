link popularity: the more high quality link points to your site, the more likely your targeted keyword rank in search page.
A measure of how popular a webpage is based on number of links pointing to that page called link popularity.
Not only link popularity but also quality of inbound links is also considered for ranking page so link popularity alone don’t determine ranking.
Inbound links are links that come from other websites or a different domain name. Outbound links are those links on your website that link out to websites with a different domain name.

Search engine uses more than basic link popularity for determining page ranking in search engine result pages. Google uses pageRank algorithm to determine value assigned to every page based on number of links point to that page called authority. As one page links to another sends authority to another. If two web pages links to one of our page of our site and if one has high page rank while other have low than authority given to our page by high page rank site is more than low page rank site. Also amount of authority passed on by a page is diluted by total number of outgoing links on that page. If page with high page rank having only one outgoing link passes more authority than same page having more outgoing link.
Google no longer publishes pageRanks data publicly so, tool we use uses their own pseudo page rank metrics eg moz uses page authority, majestic uses citation flow metrics as replacement of page rank and ahrefs uses URL rating etc.

SITEWIDE AUTHORITY(trust rank): it is the ranking given to entire domain/entire website. It include overall links and quality of those links as well as manual intervention done by google team(eg website with .gov is more trustworthy than .com. Trust rank is transferred through link in same way as page rank is transferred. Trust rank is also called domain authority. Passes authority. Trust rank also can be diluted based on number of outgoing link from particular website as in page rank. High trust rank website passes more authority if outgoing link is small. Both page rank and trust rank algorithm used to determine which page should rank higher. Like page rank google don’t publicly release trust rank data so, tools comes with it’s alternative, pseudo trust rank scores metrics, majestic website use trust flow, moz.com uses domain authority, if I enter new page, page authority changes while domain authority remain same. ahrefs uses Domain rating etc

Anchor text is important as google uses as keyword to rank that hyperlink in anchor tag.
Wordpress CMS.

Links placement: make sure link placed in body of text. Place link at top helps in human aspect easy to click. Makes sure link placed outside of javascript as google can’t read javascript. You want to have your link on page having high page rank and website with high trust rank.
We wank our link to be placed on pages that are indexed by search engine.
Add target=\_blank in anchor tag for external link but not on internal links but don’t affect in search engines only user experience.
In anchor tag one property rel=“nofollow” this tells search engine not to pass authority to this link so, used when people add comment rel=“nofollow” gets automatically added which ensure search engine aren’t taking into account on passing page rank and trust rank from your site to link site because in old days this is used to spam website as authority can be passed through commenting site. Descriptive anchor text better than image anchor text.
